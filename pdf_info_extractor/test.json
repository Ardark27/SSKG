We extend the LODE framework by Silvio Peroni to describe the classes, properties and data properties of the ontology, the OOPS! webservice by Mar\u00eda Poveda to print an evaluation and the Licensius service by Victor Rodriguez Doncel to determine the license URI and title being used. In addition, we use WebVowl to visualize the ontology and have extended Bubastis to show a complete changelog between different versions of your ontology.\n\nFeatures of WIDOCO:\n* Automatic documentation of the terms in your ontology (based on [LODE](http://www.essepuntato.it/lode/)). Now you can use Markdown on your class descriptions (see [example](doc/gallery/index.html))\n* Automatic annotation in JSON-LD snippets of the html produced.\n* Association of a provenance page which includes the history of your vocabulary (W3C PROV-O compliant).\n* Metadata extraction from the ontology plus the means to complete it on the fly when generating your ontology. Check the [best practice document](http://dgarijo.github.io/Widoco/doc/bestPractices/index-en.html) to know more about the terms recognized by WIDOCO.\n* Guidelines on the main sections that your document should have and how to complete them.\n* Integration with diagram creators ([WebVOWL](http://vowl.visualdataweb.org/webvowl/)).\n* Automatic changelog of differences between the actual and the previous version of the ontology (based on [Bubastis](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/efo/bubastis/)).\n* Separation of the sections of your html page so you can write them independently and replace only those needed.\n* Content negotiation and serialization of your ontology according to [W3C best practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/swbp-vocab-pub/)\n* Evaluation reports of your ontology (using the [OOPS! web service](http://oops.linkeddata.es/))\n* Integration with license metadata services ([Licensius](http://licensius.com/)) to automatically describe the license used in your ontology.\n", "parentHeader": ["WIzard for DOCumenting Ontologies (WIDOCO)"], "confidence": [1.0], "technique": "Header extraction"}, {"excerpt": "WIDOCO helps you to publish and create an enriched and customized documentation of your ontology automatically, by following a series of steps in a GUI. \n", "confidence": [[0.935680720359103]], "technique": "Supervised classification", "originalHeader": "WIzard for DOCumenting Ontologies (WIDOCO)"}, {"excerpt": "For a complete list of the current improvements and next features, check the [project open issues](https://github.com/dgarijo/Widoco/issues) and [milestones](https://github.com/dgarijo/Widoco/milestones) in the repository.\n \n", "confidence": [[0.991003792550711]], "technique": "Supervised classification", "originalHeader": "Current improvements", "parentHeader": ["WIzard for DOCumenting Ontologies (WIDOCO)"]}, {"excerpt": "Contributions to address any of the current issues are welcome.

WIDOCO was designed this way because it's easier to edit your introduction or description sections independently without being all aggregated together in a huge HTML document.  **When all the contents generated by WIDOCO are stored in a server, you will be able to see the documentation of your ontology using any browser**. However, if you open the `index.html` file **on your local browser**, you may see a document missing most of the sections in your documentation. This happens because browsers don't allow loading separate content when opening a file locally for security reasons. If you want to explore how your ontology would look locally, you have two options:\n\n* a) Execute WIDOCO with the `-uniteSections` flag; or select the option `add al sections in a single document` in the \"load sections\" step in the WIDOCO GUI. This will make all the sections of WIDOCO to be in the `index.html`; and you will be able to see it in your browser. Note that the **LODE visualization will not be available** when exploring your ontology locally.\n* b) Create a local server: Set up a local server (e.g., using XAMPP or Tomcat) and serve the files WIDOCO generates (in the `htdocs` folder for Apache servers).\n\nIf you place the files generated by WIDOCO in a server and access them via its URL (for example, a Github page), you should be able to see your documentation appropriately.\n", "parentHeader": ["WIzard for DOCumenting Ontologies (WIDOCO)"], "confidence": [1.0], "technique": "Header extraction"}], "download": [{"originalHeader": "Downloading the executable", "excerpt": "To download WIDOCO, you need to download a JAR executable file.
